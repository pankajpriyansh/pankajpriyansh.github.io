    <p>Swami Vivekananda was an Indian Hindu monk, a chief disciple of the 19th-century 

Indian mystic Ramakrishna.He was a key figure in the introduction of the Indian 

philosophies of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world and is credited with raising 

interfaith awareness, bringing Hinduism to the status of a major world religion during the 

late 19th century.He was a major force in the revival of Hinduism in India, and 

contributed to the concept of nationalism in colonial India.Vivekananda founded the 

Ramakrishna Math and the Ramakrishna Mission.He is perhaps best known for his speech 

which began, "Sisters and brothers of America  in which he introduced Hinduism at the 

Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago in 1893.</p>

<p>Born into an aristocratic Bengali family of Calcutta, Vivekananda was inclined towards 

spirituality. He was influenced by his Guru, Ramakrishna Deva, from whom he learnt that 

all living beings were an embodiment of the divine self; therefore, service to God could 

be rendered by service to mankind. After Ramakrishna's death, Vivekananda toured the 

Indian subcontinent extensively and acquired first-hand knowledge of the conditions 

prevailing in British India. He later travelled to the United States, representing India at the 

1893 Parliament of the World Religions. Vivekananda conducted hundreds of public and 

private lectures and classes, disseminating tenets of Hindu philosophy in the United 

States, England and Europe. In India, Vivekananda is regarded as a patriotic saint and his 

birthday is celebrated there as National Youth Day.</p>
